## Does Explinable AI (XAI) tools helps in breaking the security of encrypted decision tree model? 

With encryption, we mean either the order-preserving (OPE) or homomorphic (HE).

Run a comparison using the SHAP tool for decision tree explainability before and after encryption.  

It is uncertian whether explainability provides a route for attacking decision tree encryption.
