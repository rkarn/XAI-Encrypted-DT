## Does Explinable AI (XAI) tools help in breaking the security of encrypted decision tree model? 

With encryption, we mean either the order-preserving (OPE) or homomorphic (HE).

Run a comparison using the SHAP tool for decision tree explainability before and after encryption.  


In the context of an order-preserving encrypted decision tree classifier, the goal of an attacker might be to infer sensitive information about the model's structure, such as encrypted node threshold values. Here's a hypothetical scenario of how SHAP could potentially be misused in an attack:

1.SHAP Analysis on Encrypted Data:

The attacker may attempt to apply SHAP analysis to the encrypted input data, understanding the contribution of each encrypted feature to the model's output.

2. Feature Contributions and Thresholds:

SHAP values provide insights into how changes in feature values influence the model's predictions. If an attacker gains access to these SHAP values, they might attempt to deduce the order or magnitude of the original feature values.

3. Reverse-Engineering Encrypted Thresholds:

Using the knowledge gained from SHAP values and the impact of feature changes, an attacker could try to reverse-engineer the encrypted thresholds used in the decision tree nodes. This involves deciphering the mapping between the encrypted values and the original feature values.

*It's crucial to note that this is a hypothetical scenario, and the success of such an attack would depend on several factors, including the strength of the encryption scheme, the complexity of the model, and the attacker's knowledge of the system.*
